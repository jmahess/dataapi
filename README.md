# dataapi
Code test data api for users

To run the code run: ./dataapi.py

The api runs on localhost on port 5000 so the endpoints are:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/users
http://127.0.0.1:5000/messages

Make sure that you have a folder called 'db' in the same directory as where you run ./dataapi.py as this is where the sqlite database will be saved.
